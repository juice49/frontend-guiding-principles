# 1. Don’t push the rock up the hill

When creating a website, we have some primary goals:

- The website is robust.
- The website works well at many viewport sizes, and on many devices, under many network conditions.
- The website is accessible.
- The website is fast and lightweight.
- The website is maintainable.

Sometimes, we may be given a design concept that is at odds with these goals. Perhaps we don't have sufficient budget to implement the design _and_ ensure it is robust. Or, perhaps implementing the design will cause us to exceed our _performance budget_.

Talk to the designers and stakeholder when this occurs. Usually a compromise can be found that allows everybody to achieve their goals.

There are a great many techniques applied regularly on the web that make it difficult to meet our core objectives. My favourite example is the "off canvas" menu, of which I've never seen a perfect implementation. These things can appear deceptively easy.

Have the natural flow of the web inform your design.

Likewise, if a design can be implemented multiple ways, spend some time to seek the way that best meets the natural flow of the web.

Let go of the notion that you have, or need, absolute control over your presentation.

I’ve observed many developers feeling confident when they can assert their presentation matches exact pixel measures.
